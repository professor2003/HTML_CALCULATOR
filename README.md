# HTML_CALCULATOR
This is a calculator that i have built using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
I have used javascsript functionalities to give the output of the caluclations. The output screen is divided into three divs.
I have also made sure that I used CDN for all the sources and references so that anyone can view this project without having any issue.
Do suggest improvements.
